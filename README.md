# VKNewsFeed

Mobile application for surfing groups posts, commentaries and etc. from very popular social networking service "VK".

This project has been developed according to very popular libraries nowadays: **REALM, RXJAVA 2, RETROFIT 2, DAGGER 2, 
BUTTERKNIFE, MOXY, FCM(Firebase Cloud Messaging).**

This project was a great opportunity to grow my skills with all these libraries in real project. 
**Also this was my first time,when I create a real project, which is based on the architecture principle  - MVP (Model View Presenter).**
This project it is a result of internet course which I passed.
